Types of Number
== == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == ==
int() - whole integers
float() - decimal numbers
complex() - numbers consisting of a real part and imaginary part

Type-cast: converting from one type of number to another





== == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == ==
Arithmetic
== == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == == ==
no spaces between number and operators
    ex. print(1+num)


Integers can be super large, but when multipled by float() it will be shown as scientific notation

// - gives the other part of modulo (good for dividing and rounding down, no need to float it down)
% - gives the remainder 

print(47//8) ==> 5
print(47%8) ==> 7

String

print(len("Spaghetti")) ==> 9

Indexing into a string works -> print(("Spaghetti"[0])) ==> "S"
Negative Indexing is allowed
